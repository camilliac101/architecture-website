            <h2>Introduction to Web Application Architecture</h2>
            <p>Web application architecture is the backbone of modern websites and apps, determining how data flows 
               between the user interface, backend servers, and databases. A well-structured architecture improves 
               performance, security, and scalability.</p>
            <p>From simple static websites in the early internet days to highly interactive, cloud-based applications today, 
               web architecture has evolved significantly to meet growing user demands.</p>

            <h2>Brief History of Web Application Architecture</h2>
            <p>The way web applications are built has changed over time. Here’s a quick look at how architecture evolved:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1990s – Static Websites:</strong> Early websites were simple HTML pages with no real interactivity.</li>
                <li><strong>Early 2000s – Server-Side Applications:</strong> Technologies like PHP and ASP allowed websites to generate content dynamically.</li>
                <li><strong>2010s – Client-Side Development:</strong> JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, Vue) enabled rich, interactive web experiences.</li>
                <li><strong>Present – Cloud & Microservices:</strong> Modern apps use cloud computing, APIs, and microservices for better scalability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why Web Application Architecture Matters</h2>
            <p>Every time you use a web app—whether it's social media, online banking, or e-commerce—you are interacting 
               with a carefully structured system. A well-designed architecture ensures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> Faster load times and a smoother user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The ability to handle growing users without crashing.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Protection against cyber threats and data breaches.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As web technologies continue to evolve, developers must choose the right architecture to ensure 
               reliability and efficiency.</p>
